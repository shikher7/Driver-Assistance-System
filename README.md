# Automated-Driving-System

### Overview 

In this era of technology, rapid and influential advancements are being made in the field of vehicular transportation. We are heading towards a more automated world and self-driving vehicles will play a big role in its progress.

In this project, we propose a prototype of an autonomous car driving software that will have the ability to drive by itself on road avoiding any obstacles and making turns on its own, also it will have the ability to understand traffic signs and act accordingly. We intend to showcase various safety and control features which can be incorporated in future Self-Driving Cars through our prototype software.

Traffic road sign and traffic light detection is an important feature to enable self-driving capability of an autonomous vehicle. We propose to design and implement an intelligent model to extract the road sign and traffic light from a natural complex image using a camera with the help of machine learning. 

The proposed system will be one step forward toward the dream of a fully autonomous world.

### Problem Statement

Technology has come a long way in the past decade with automation playing a pivotal role to make a lot of these advancements feasible. Transportation is one such field which has been highly influenced by Automation. 

The NHTSA estimates that 94% of serious crashes are due to human error, such as drunk or distracted driving. Automation in Vehicles plays a big part in removing these human errors. 

But with the rise of Automation in Vehicles, A major concern of safety has always been addressed. There has always been debate on how safe and ethical an autonomous Vehicle is?

An Autonomous Car need to make instantaneous decisions on when to slow down, swerve or continue acceleration normally. This is a continuing challenge for developers to create an autonomous system that is able to make such decisions accurately and in real time every time.

Through this project, we intend to find a solution to some of the major problems faced by self-driving cars and thus take another step into the future of Autonomous Cars.
